# AudioChart addon for NVDA
AudioChart add-on for NVDA allows you to play excel time series as a continuous sound.
## Download

[Current stable release](https://github.com/mltony/nvda-audio-chart/releases/latest/download/audioChart.nvda-addon).

## Usage
Select a cell or a column of cells containing time series in Microsoft Excel.
Keystrokes:

* NVDA+A: Play audio chart.
* NVDA+A twice quickly: Show calibration dialog window.

In laptop layout, press NVDA+Control+Shift+A instead.

## Source code
Source code is available at <http://github.com/mltony/nvda-audio-chart>.

# Test
> The use case for this is quite limited,

I compiled for you all positive feedback as well as people looking for or suggesting IndenNav that I have received in the last 6 years. The deduped list below contains 43 users - 3 of whom are Jaws users looking for IndentNav functionality in Jaws, the rest are NVDA users either praising IndenNav, or recommending it to others or saying something that suggests that they are using it. Most of these are from public email lists and github, so these are all verifyable - except for the last section, that lists people sending private emails to me. I hope this serves as evidence that the add-on is quite popular in NVDA community and people do have legitimate use cases for it.

    > While not necessarily helpful at all, under NVDA, I use IndentNav add-on to let me jump around python code blocks in VS code - it will not read out the line it lands on, but, does allow me to navigate through indentation levels, and thus code blocks easily enough - only trade-off at moment is will use one of it's keystrokes and then use normal read line keystroke to make sure where I am?

    great job with indent nav and sentence nav!!!
    > I just wanted to say how great your two addons, Sentence Nav and Indent Nav, are. I have been thinking there should be something like those two for a long time, ever since I got back into programming after losing my eyesight. For a long time I relied on using EdSharp for coding in python, since no other editor or IDE allowed me to navigate around by indentation and in a language like python that is fundamentally necessary. I really wished there was a addon for NVDA that would allow me to use whatever editor and be able to nav around byindentation.
    > Really great job on that one!
    > ... indent nav is a must for any programmer.
